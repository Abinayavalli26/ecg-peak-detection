# ECG Peak Detection using MATLAB

This project focuses on detecting R-peaks from an ECG signal using MATLAB. A synthetic ECG signal is generated with added noise to simulate real-world conditions. The signal is filtered using a Butterworth bandpass filter. After filtering, R-peaks are identified, and heart rate is calculated based on peak intervals.

## Project Overview

- Simulated ECG with added noise
- Applied bandpass Butterworth filter (0.5–40 Hz)
- Detected R-peaks using peak detection logic
- Calculated heart rate in beats per minute (BPM)
- Visualized raw, filtered, and annotated ECG signals

## Included Files

- ecg_peak_detection.m – MATLAB script
- raw_ecg.png – Raw noisy ECG plot
- filtered_ecg.png – Filtered ECG plot
- r_peaks_detected.png – ECG plot with detected peaks

## Tools Used

- MATLAB
- Signal Processing Toolbox
- Core functions: butter, filtfilt, findpeaks

## Learning Outcomes

- Gained understanding of ECG waveform structure
- Applied filtering to biomedical signals
- Learned practical signal processing with MATLAB
- Visualized each stage of signal transformation
