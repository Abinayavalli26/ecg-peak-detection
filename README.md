# ECG Peak Detection â€“ MATLAB Mini Project

This project demonstrates how to process and analyze ECG signals using MATLAB. It involves simulating a noisy ECG signal, denoising it with a Butterworth bandpass filter, detecting R-peaks, and estimating heart rate (BPM).


##  Features

- âœ… Simulation of ECG-like signal with noise
- âœ… Bandpass filtering (0.5â€“40 Hz) using Butterworth filter
- âœ… R-peak detection using `findpeaks()`
- âœ… Heart rate estimation (in BPM)
- âœ… Visualization of raw, filtered, and annotated ECG signals


##  Output Plots

- `raw_ecg.png` â€“ Noisy ECG signal
- `filtered_ecg.png` â€“ After bandpass filtering
- `r_peaks_detected.png` â€“ R-peaks marked on filtered signal


##  Tools Used

- MATLAB
- Signal Processing Toolbox
- `butter()`, `filtfilt()`, `findpeaks()`


## Learning Outcomes

- Hands-on experience in biomedical signal processing
- Understanding of ECG waveforms and heart rate extraction
- Practical skills in digital filtering and peak detection
